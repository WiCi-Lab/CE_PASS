You can directly run the “train_CMoE_mixer2.py” file to obtain the channel prediction results. Now, this code is a preliminary version composed of a few redundant statements, we will try my best to release the clean codes and add the necessary annotations in the future. Note that in the training stage, the different hyper-parameters setup will result in slight difference for final channel estimation performance. According to our training experiences and some carried attempts, the hyper-parameters and network architecture can be further optimized to obtain better channel estimation performance gain, e.g., the training learning rate, batchsize and epochs.
